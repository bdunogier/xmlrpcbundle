# Exception handling
Catch exceptions occuring during an XML-RPC request and format an appropriate response for them.

# Add boolean & nil types
Oops...

# Refactor XML-RPC controllers result
Change XML-RPC controllers to return a single value, not a response. Remove XmlRpc\Response if not useful (shouldn't be)

# Tag requests as XML-RPC
During Request event, so that the view event knows what to look for.
